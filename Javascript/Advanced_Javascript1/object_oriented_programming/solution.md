## Define encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance in your own words

**encapsulations** is a situation whereby data are encapsulated into a class such that other functions or classes cannot directly change the data.

**abstraction** is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

**inheritance** is when a child class inherits functionality from a parent class.
